he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he Your future is a thing of the past Isnt it always the way One ought to have known Heh perhaps one did know One should have read the signs So predictable What were the odds That narrows your possibilities a great deal Ask again later Faith in fate restored Interpret that as you will Oh now Ive seen it all You surprise me You died before your time But I predicted a long life for you Huh go figure A little foresight couldve prevented that As planned He he he he he he he he he Ha ha ha Ha ha I never pictured you dead Even you shouldve seen that coming But you didnt He ha Ha ha Ha haha ha Ho ho ho Ha ha ha He he he he Hm hm hm hm Hm hm Hm hm hm hm hm hm Hmhm Hm ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ho ho ho ho ho ho He ha ha he ha ha Hu hu Hm hm Oh ho ho ho Ah ho ho Heh heh Consequences will never be the same First blood Out of fifty possibilities that was my preferred First blood Oh ho ho Beware of stairs You will die in a house fire I see you dying of extreme old age Or perhaps a very old person will kill you One or the other This prophecy supersedes all previous prophecies Ignore all previous prophecies I have a prophecy to deliver Ignore all prior utterances Prepare for unforeseen consequences Beware lest you drown in the font of Avernus Avoid the abysmal fortune that stews in a malicious pit Also avoid stewed prunes and their pits An irate chemist will surely precipitate your deaths You shall almost certainly exhale your last in an icy blast I foresee an end to magic Your end in particular I envision not one but two tempests to twist your fate awry Fear death along the edge that is both axe and man Beware the life that ends in a dream that never does I see a hero caught and hauled in ligatures of flame And I hear a faint yeehaw Beware lest you be oermastered by the bellicose master of beasts He who seeks blood shall seek you who are full of it Run not when you are ruptured lest you run to your own finish Five heads make a bountiful harvest but hell be happy with the price he gets for even one Mark my words of caution well and never share a split Peering through the darkling mists of fate I see pincushions and mucus So much mucus She waits for you patiently plucking her strings with all eight eyes adoze Beware the knight who commandingly demands do you even rift One there is who wishes to convert you to his cause Be not persuaded and take not his pamphlets Guard yourself against burning shafts and make no pact with death A time I foresee when the clock stops you Blue lips whisper of the doom that comes sweetly from Icewrack Wary be ye of the one who can pointedly see in the dark A vision by fate vouchsafed I have of five braves buried in a shallow grave Prophets and counterprophets So it has come to this Even now the weathercrafter shapes for you a stormy end Doom Doom Doom Doom Hehe Ahem Any foe of Slyraks savior would be a welcome ally You get where Im coming from Shafts of ice shall nail you to your tomb tomb tomb A hero may grow older until he meets one boulder When the earth ceases trembling which of us will stand Those who wish to reach old age with impunity should avoid the elderly and seek immunity Beware there is a fire that will put you out I foresee four flames Sweetly speaks the doeeyed one who means to do you in I see a blackness none can see or name or understand until it is too late for them You ought to read Chronosphere of a Death Foretold Its a prophetic book When the whirling one rains death upon your head no bunker can protect you The life that breaks today may be your own You shall be cured of ignorance in the name of Quas Wex and Exort Oh ignorant one er thats what I hear he calls you A bright spark blinded me but not before I had a glimpse of havoc and chaos untethered Two heads patrol a frigid path Beware lest you be burned Your last dance will be a blade dance Ponies I see ponies A terrible vision indeed Trampled falls the hero beneath ethereal hooves Beware lest ye be shattered by a ghostly frigate Upon the field of battle one awaits who commands your fate Before this day has ended you will fall beneath the shadow of a soul far more tormented than your own Let fear not force you all to huddle close or ice will wrap you hard up in its chains Learn to be your own lifes master lest ye be ruled by evil servitude I sense that fate may hold for you a hottie II mean one who is quite so Fear neither witch nor wardrobe Tis a demon beast that fingers your demise What fortune can prevent a meeting with your own true form today We blunder in a moonless night The light of foresight has been eclipsed Against the one who can shift his shape there can be no shifting of ones fate Beware lest ye be skewered by fortunes reversal I dare not peer too closely at the future for if it gazes back I might be petrified Four friends await divided from earth But they are no friends of mine She who bears your fate rides through the woods unseen blessed by the moon that curses you No empathy test can save you from the watery replicant Cover your ears that you may a deafening fate forestall Your life shall be uprooted by a shaggier prophet than I A scythe I see in a sadists grip wholl cut five heroes down Beware the dark that spreads its wings and falls at any hour A vengeful fate whispers a cryptic phrase nyx nyx nyx What can it mean Two wise foolish heads I see to strike you dumb and dead To forecast what awaits I must petition the Omniscience It would seem I am not the only Harbinger of evil tidings here I lift the veil of destiny behold the phantoms face A horde of lancers gathers hoarding your death between them The death of a star will seem a small thing compared to your own demise It knows not why it kills you but confusion quells it not Youll meet your fate where fresh meats chopped by the butcher wait Blame me not for lack of warning when your life goes swirling swirling down the drain It gives me no pleasure to speak of the pain that awaits you all Peering at future tempests I see the storms eye glaring back Death strikes from the shadows stabs from behind then chuckles and fades away Be careful what you cast for stolen spells may readily undo their wielder Some rulers blind with their majesty Others by scouring eyeballs from their sockets Your shadow shall become possessed by its unrightful lord Nevermore to know your fate when shadows raze your soul Vexed and hexed by fortunes shackles shall ye be When I listen for your future I hear naught but a great silence Wrathful fates foreseen will fall on you from ghastly heights Guard yourself like sunken treasure or lose your life to the treasures guardian From shadows one invites you to a deadly dance The assassins bullet has but one name upon it yours A haunted hunter I perceive but what she utters passes understanding Misfortune will cross the world to break you Can your fate be sidestepped We shall see Your lifes horizon darkens Heed me well a storm is coming To the rogue who wields the hammer of the gods all mortal forms resemble crooked nails It needs no expert in explosives to descry the hazards here Psionics might befuddle some foretellers but I can see the clever traps she lays What terror sunders no mere oracle may put together On this shore I bear witness to a fate forever ravaged and illwrought One there is who fears the trees and that one you should fear You are fated to be an element in a madmans failed experiment If you see the mountain move in your direction run No matter how quickly you move enmeshed you may become in the overgrowth Beware of knives and forks and also spoons One less to answer for Mine Is that all I saw that Ineluctable Inevitable Totally foreseeable Confirmed As planned Wish fulfilled Scry candy Mine Denied Uhuh Surprise Fate cannot be denied Descried A glimpse of what awaits Your fate cleaves to me Denied like your dreams Huh huh huh

sort of thing I had not thought it possible My final utterance Its too late Ive seen everything Ill see myself out shall I Scry no more I was wrong about you All part of the plan So it goes I want to die Again again and once again One is doomed to repeat what one has not mastered My eyes have been opened to new possibilities If not now when We dwell in a realm of uncertainty That was odd indeed Many lives and many meanings to each Like the past Im never dead Im not even past What I descried in my unmaking cannot easily be put into words Is it really that time again Precisely as planned Haha

alliance yet you do make a compelling argument I remember that one from some time long past That one admired my wings but could not be trusted to care for her own It would seem that almost anything can call itself a dragon in this age If you are truly some sort of dragon you must be a juvenile form I sense this book of yours may be full of erroneous information A poor specimen not worthy of being mounted I learned nothing from close observation of Tinkers demise Again Tinkers death yields no interesting conclusions Unnerving I understood every word Your comments cut me to the quick I have been to Claszureme They still speak of their relief at being rid of you Whats this A fascinating substance First Blood It shall be duly noted Ah Wisp your mordant wit is wasted on these gross beings Excellent an apparition of exceptional age What I wonder can it teach me Rumor speaks of the Lone Druid as an ancient one yet here I see barely a sprat What the Outworld represents and why one would destroy it is now a quandary that intrigues me To be a true enigma it would be best to style oneself on something less studied than gravity From what primordial eon does the rock of Tiny hail

Abaddon Abaddon Lord of Avernus This place appears like a vision in the mist From House Avernus I set forth I have known from an early age since the Avernal Fonts first and greatest revelation that this one would be in the bag The coils of life and death now bind us all The fog of war is no match for the mist of fate Yes I ride Such power I travel with the mist Chosen of Avernus Indeed So it goes I see The mist moves So be it Like shapes in mist I should say so Well studied I see the way I just might I might at that More than likely As counselled Very cunning So I have sworn Things are rarely as they seem Indeed To the fray On them Submit Mark me well Follow me Ride onward From the mist By the House Avernus Who goes there To the foe Run them down Fly my steed Submit By what right do you tread here You have called death upon yourself The eyes of mist have seen you Deathcoil Death for you life for me Coil of healing The coil of death ensnares Coil and recoil Coil keep you Coil of life Take shelter A shield of power A shield impenetrable Wrapped in the mist Blessed of Avernus Aphotic Shield Shielded The mistblade bites Foe to all Join in Here friends Take this dog down None shall mourn you Down with you Come I dare you Go ahead Throw in against me Ill take your worst Just try it Your weapons betray you That harms me not Do that again What harms you heals me Throw in against me Come at me For the House Avernus The spectral mist fills my soul to overflowing I can scarce contain such power All this was promised me and more The murk of Avernus floods my veins Look upon the Lord of Avernus and beware Deep I drink from the font of fate New power stirs within A dark thirst slaked The mist chose me it is not mine to command Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm Such ignoble blood taints the soil where it spills An offering unworthy of the House Avernus Your fate was foreshadowed in the mist The murk of oblivion reclaims you In the mists of time you are but a blur To die at a noble hand is no guarantee of a noble death Drink deep of the mist as it turns to black The mist is your master I will see you in the shadow of Avernus Drowned in the Font of Avernus Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm Ha ha ah ah aha haha ha ah ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Mm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

shadows Shaman I swept away your Red Mist Army Axe Back you go into the miasmal fog You should have sought me in the mist Bloodseeker First Blood An offering worthy of the House Avernus Tell me where to walk and not to walk Techies Come friend let us fill their souls with terror Waste not your energy Zet but wield it well Dazzle no foe would be pleased to see us two together The powers of ill reprieve are joined in us Dazzle The coffers of Avernus will open if the hunt goes well today Weave for us a victory in battle Your phantom presence is always welcome Axe a fellow fighter of the mist I see youve thrown in with us Tiny Honors to you and to the rogues code you follow There is no better ally than one who shifts like the tides of war A trifle Souls into gold A fair conversion Nice

Reclaimed for Avernus Baptized in the font Avernus death means something different to me The mist parts and I am born anew The Lord of Avernus is reborn From the murk I emerge We ride out refreshed The mist conceals and then reveals I drank deep from the font and am renewed A noble rebirth I have enriched my understanding of death Life and death have lost a little of their mystery Death and I we have an understanding Await the day Time will tell A power concealed A tribute to my house Double damage Two deaths bearing down Haste Let us run on to our fate Illusion Invisibility The haunted mist
